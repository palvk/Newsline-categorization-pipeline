# ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Functionality Fixes - Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dynamic Visualizations** 
- **Problem**: Visualizations were static and didn't change based on article input
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced static HTML visualizations with live Plotly charts
  - Added real-time data summary metrics
  - Implemented dynamic chart generation based on current analyzed data
  - Added multiple visualization types: Category Distribution, Impact Analysis, Sector Performance, Sentiment Analysis, Word Cloud, Custom Analysis

### 2. **Dynamic Evaluation Metrics**
- **Problem**: Model metrics showed the same results regardless of input
- **Solution**:
  - Added dynamic prediction section that shows different results for different articles
  - Implemented real-time ML model predictions with confidence scores
  - Added comparison between ML model predictions and rule-based analysis
  - Created live article analysis display with individual results

### 3. **Enhanced Analysis Pipeline**
- **Problem**: Analysis was too simplistic and not responsive to content
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced impact determination with weighted keyword scoring
  - Added context-aware analysis (financial numbers detection)
  - Improved reason determination with multiple pattern matching
  - Added sector-specific reasoning logic
  - Implemented sentiment-based fallback with multipliers
